# Semantic-Segmentation-Loss-Functions
This Repository is implementation of majority of Semantic Segmentation Loss Functions in Keras. Our Survey paper is available on arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14822

In this paper we have summarized 15 such segmentation based loss functions that has been proven to provide state of results in different domain datasets.

We are still in process of adding more loss functions, so far we this repo consists of:
1. Binary Cross Entropy
2. Weighted Cross Entropy
3. Balanced Cross Entropy
4. Dice Loss
5. Focal loss
6. Tversky loss
7. Focal Tversky loss
8. log-cosh dice loss (ours)
